Goal of this project is to create engines to play two-player board game [Santorini](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini).

By appropriate game setup (in file [HelloApplication.java](src/main/java/com/example/santorini_engine_gui/HelloApplication.java)) we can allow user to play the game himself using simple GUI, as well as replace one or both players by chosen engine.
